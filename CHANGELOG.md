## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Backend TypeScript service** — all server-side API logic migrated from legacy `code/api` into a new isolated `backend/` service
- **Full API separation** — ownership matrix produced for every `frontend/api` route (`backend-owned`, `desktop-local-only`, `frontend-render-only`); all product `/api/*` routes now owned exclusively by `backend`; desktop sidecar refactored to local control-plane utilities only; web dev and production routing behavior preserved unchanged
- **Globe loading overlay** — animated spinner with localized text hides the blank globe until earth textures complete loading; fades out once the 3D mesh first renders; overlay text uses `t('components.globe.loadingGlobe')` with RTL support
- **Aircraft & vessel photos in map popups** — military flight popups fetch tail-specific photos from Planespotters.net (priority 1), with Wikipedia REST API fallback for aircraft type and named naval vessels; photos render at a user-friendly aspect ratio alongside popup metadata; lookup results cached in memory for the page lifetime
- **Material Design v3** — M3 visual system implemented in pure CSS and vanilla TypeScript with no external libraries: OKLCH tonal palette, tonal surface elevation overlays, M3 typography scale, corner-radius shape tokens, state layer feedback (hover/pressed/focused/dragged), and motion easing/duration tokens; split across 8 CSS modules (`md3-palette.css`, `md3-roles.css`, `md3-typography.css`, `md3-shape.css`, `md3-elevation.css`, `md3-state.css`, `md3-motion.css`, `md3-components.css`) loaded via `base-layer.css`
- **Virtual scrolling for News panel** — `VirtualList` (DOM-recycling fixed-height) and `WindowedList<T>` (generic windowed generic list) classes; `WindowedList` activates in `NewsPanel` above a configurable item threshold, eliminating layout thrashing on large feeds
- **Lato as default sans-serif font-family** — set as first entry in `--font-sans` stack for all non-Arabic UI text; Arabic retains its own stack
- **Sentry error tracking** — `@sentry/browser` initialized early in the bundle with noise filters for map renderer frames, stale DOM reference errors, and anonymous-only stack traces; disabled on localhost and in Tauri desktop builds

### Fixed

- **Map fullscreen mode — popups and country brief panel hidden** — map popups and the country brief panel are now correctly rendered and positioned when the map enters fullscreen mode
- **Maps resize bug** — map container correctly handles resize events; no layout artifacts or blank areas after panel resizing
- **UCDP conflict events not appearing** — upstream data-fetching issue resolved; UCDP events now render on the conflict map layer
- **Iran attacks map layer returning no data** — data flow through endpoint and cache fixed; Iran event markers now appear correctly
- **GlobeMap intermittent white sphere** — texture loading race condition resolved; globe no longer renders as a blank white sphere after initial load
- **Frontend errors and warnings** — most frontend runtime errors and warnings identified and resolved

### Changed

- **Frontend converted to pure client bundle** — `frontend/api` and `frontend/server` legacy server-side directories removed after parity verification; Tauri sidecar refactored to expose only local-machine utilities; no API contract or call-site changes required in frontend components
- **Self-hosted Redis Support** — Redis client with graceful fallback; cached endpoint behavior is unchanged
- **Discord and Desktop download popups removed** — transient onboarding modals removed from UI
- **Mobile app menu revised** — navigation structure and layout updated for better usability on small screens

### Internationalization

- **Map localizations updated** — continent, country, and region names fully localized across all 21 locales
- **Arabic revisions** — all missing localizable text covered: labels, button states, popup fields, fallback strings
- **Globe loading text localized** — `components.globe.loadingGlobe` key added to all 21 locale files with RTL-aware styling
- **Live News Channel display names localized** in Arabic
- **Panel titles with country names localized** across all 21 locales
- **Country brief component labels and computed values localized** — hardcoded English strings replaced with `t()` calls throughout country brief panels
- **Map tooltip and popup dynamic data localized** — military aircraft types, naval vessel types, and fallback labels (e.g., "Unknown") now use `t()` with `getLocalizedGeoName()` fallback instead of hardcoded strings
- **Conflict zone names localized** in map popups and tooltips
- **AI insights localized** — strategic posture, deduction, and country brief AI outputs now respond in the currently selected UI language
- **News localization fixed** — localized news feed digest was not being applied; now correctly reflects the active locale
- **RTL fix** — special letter-spacing styles removed in RTL mode; Arabic text is now readable without excessive character spacing

### Performance

- **Widget re-render memoization** — panel state updates no longer trigger full DOM rebuilds; only changed data causes targeted re-renders
- **Viewport-based lazy loading** — `IntersectionObserver` defers widget initialization until they scroll into view; panels off-screen consume no resources
- **Expensive UI operations cached** — computationally intensive calculations (map projections, icon generation, score aggregations) are now memoized for the lifecycle of each component
- **Timer API hygiene** — `setInterval` and `setTimeout` usage replaced with more reliable browser scheduler APIs throughout the frontend

### UI / Branding

- **App branding** — logo, name, and visual identity applied consistently across all pages and the desktop app
- **Map layer toggle icons** — custom SVG icons replace emoji throughout the layer list; consistent sizing and styling
- **Map marker icons** — SVG icons replace emoji across all map layers for visual consistency and crisp rendering at all DPR levels
- **Material Design v3 form elements** — inputs and selects styled to M3 specs with small rounded corners; consistent across all panels and settings pages
- **Map UI components styled to M3** — tooltips, popups, and control overlays follow M3 elevation and shape conventions
- **Logo and map container styling** updated to match the new design system

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Military bases map layer** — 1,058 global installations seeded from curated geopolitical bases (226 entries) and MIRTA US installations dataset (832 entries); GEO + META hash architecture with versioned atomic-swap keys
- **Military bases popup i18n** — type badge and stat row now use `t('popups.base.types.*')` with `getLocalizedGeoName()` as a runtime fallback for unknown types; covers all 16 type values (`us-nato`, `china`, `russia`, `uk`, `france`, `india`, `italy`, `uae`, `turkey`, `japan`, `us`, `naval`, `air`, `marine`, `space`, `other`)
- **FlightAware tracking link** — military flight popups now include a localized "Track on FlightAware ↗" link (`https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/{callsign}`) when a callsign is present, all 21 locales translated
- **Arabic translations** — filled 19 missing `ar` keys: `panels.airlineIntel`, `panels.worldClock`, `common.all`, full `components.securityAdvisories` block (loading, critical, health, sources, refresh, infoTooltip, levels, time), `panels.satelliteFires.noData` (via correct key path)
- **English panel keys** — added `panels.airlineIntel` and `panels.worldClock` to `en.json` (missing from all locales)
- **Base type locale coverage** — added 12 new `popups.base.types.*` keys across all 21 locale files (`france`, `india`, `italy`, `japan`, `uae`, `uk`, `us`, `naval`, `air`, `marine`, `space`, `other`)

### Fixed

- **Military bases endpoint returning empty data** — tier filter defaulted missing `tier` fields to `2`, causing the `zoom < 5 && tier > 1` guard to drop all 1,058 unseeded entries; changed default to `1` (always shown) and relaxed thresholds to `> 2` / `> 3` to let clustering handle density
- **Military bases seeder blocking on cleanup** — replaced 5-minute `sleep()` + `DEL` with `EXPIRE` pipeline call so the seeder exits immediately and Redis TTL-expires old version keys autonomously
- **Iran events map returning no markers** — `getCachedJson(REDIS_KEY)` in both backend and frontend `list-iran-events.ts` was missing `raw=true`, causing the `NODE_ENV=development` key prefix (`development:dev:*`) to produce a cache miss against the raw seeded key
- **RSS proxy blocked feeds** — added 14 missing domains to all 6 allowlist files (`backend/api/_rss-allowed-domains.js`, both `shared/rss-allowed-domains.json` copies, both `.cjs` wrappers, `frontend` equivalents); domain count 278 → 292
- **Wrong i18n key for satellite fires no-data** — `data-loader.ts` referenced `panels.satelliteFires.noData` (a plain string node) instead of the correct `components.satelliteFires.noData`
